# Drink Water
## Instructions
Just have your Desktop Environment (e.g KDE) run drinkwater.sh on autostart (for KDE do on startup, not before session). Ignore the .service file.

Change the path in drinkwater.sh to match where drinkwater.gf is!

### Path
<code>"$HOME/projects/bash/drinkWater/drinkwater.gif"</code>

Change /projects/bash/drinkWater/drinkwater.gif to wherever you want your image to be. You can change 

<code>sleep 1800</code>

if you want to be reminded more or less than every half hour. 1800 is in seconds.
